        If you are still within the 60-day warranty in order to return your product first call customer service at 866-211-9433 to receive a return merchandise authorization number. With this number, you can then send your items back to the address provided below for a refund of your purchase price, less processing and handling or a replacement.</p>
        <p><strong>Returns, Refunds and Exchanges Policy</strong></p>
        <p><strong>How To Return An Item:</strong><br />
        You must contact us via email prior to returning your product.  Failure to do so will result in delays of either replacements or refunds.  You must return the item within 30 days of your purchase.  The returns department is not for defective items.  If your unit is not working, contact info@glowbowl.com for instructions.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Please email info@glowbowl.com to request a refund and we will assign you a RMA#. (RMA numbers are not needed or assigned for defective units.)</li>
            <li>Mail your returned item to:</li>

            <p>Include in your package a signed letter stating the reason for your return, your full name, your email address, your phone number and if possible the original receipt.  This is important as sometimes packages get damaged in transit or need to be damaged to open and cannot be identified where they came from which may result in a delay in a refund, or no refund.<br />

              <li>Merchandise that has been used, or altered will not be accepted for return or exchange (unless they are defective).</li>
