          <p><strong>Terms & Conditions</strong><br />
          Welcome to glowbowl.com. If you use or order from our Site, you agree to our Terms of Use. The information contained in this Site, including but not limited to these Terms of Use, is subject to change without notice. Your use of the Site following any such change constitutes your agreement to follow and be bound by the rules as changed.<br />
          GlowBowl LLC creates and controls this Site from its offices in Sunrise, FLorida USA, and if your orders are accepted, they will be accepted in Florida. By using this Site, you agree that Florida law will govern these Terms of Use and your relations with GlowBowl, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of laws. If you do not agree, please do not use this site. If you choose to access this Site from another location, you do so on your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws.</p>
          <p><strong>Age of Users</strong><br />
          This Site should not be used by children under age 13 unless with permission and supervision of a parent or guardian. We do not knowingly collect personal information on this Site from or about children. Only adults and children over 13 may order from us on our Web Site.</p>
          <p><strong>Content Errors</strong><br />
          Prices and availability of products are subject to change without notice. Our goal is to provide only up-to-date and accurate information to our customers. But mistakes happen and occasionally product descriptions on GlowBowl.com or in our catalog may contain typographical errors, inaccuracies, or omissions concerning product specifications, prices or availability, and product photos may sometimes depict a different product version than the one we will ship. We reserve the right to correct and update information on our Site at any time, without notice. We also reserve the right to revoke any offer that contains an error, or for a product that is not available, at any time prior to shipment, including after you have submitted an order and whether or not the order has been confirmed and your credit card charged. In that event, we will reverse any applicable charges that have been made to your credit card, and if the product is or will be available will attempt to contact you concerning the mistake to receive your instructions as to whether you wish to purchase on the basis of the corrected information. If you believe a product that we ship you is not as described, you may return it to us.</p>
          <p><strong>Account Registration</strong><br />
          If you establish an electronic account with us, you are responsibility for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, and for restricting access to the computer(s) you have used to place orders.</p>

If additional stock is expected within the next 30 days, we will ship your back-ordered items when they arrive and charge your card for those items at time of shipment. If an item is out-of-stock and not expected to arrive within 30 days, we will contact you about the delay and ask for your instructions as to whether you want the product shipped when it becomes available. Some of our items are drop-shipped by the manufacturer. In that case we will charge your card when the manufacturer notifies us that it has shipped the item(s).

If we reject your order, we will attempt to notify you using the e-mail address or other contact information you have given us with the order Your credit card will normally not be charged if we reject an order, but we will process a refund if a charge has been made against your card.</p>
          <p><strong>Order Acceptance and Confirmation</strong><br />
          Your orders are only accepted by shipment of the item(s). Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation does not create a contract to sell you the product. GlowBowl reserves the right to accept or decline your order for any reason prior to shipment.</p>
